I'm considering doing my project on a recent published article titled "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan". This paper is within my region of focus but is also one of the few papers that takes a quantitative approach to Central Asian studies. It attempts to measure the effect of the ethnic riots of 2010 in Osh, Kyrgyzstan had on overall prosocial behavior. It relies on an extensive survey that the researchers preformed in Osh, Kyrgyzstan but this data is available. I am concerned that because it is not an observational study, however, that I may be limited in expanding the paper myself. The main statistical techinques used are OLS regressions. Also, some of the figures are not included in the replication data because they were made via GIS software or otherwise taken from other sources. The code itself is actually very clear and uses packages I am familiar with. It is also well formatted with separate rmd files for each figure in question.
